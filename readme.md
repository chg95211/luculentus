Luculentus
==========

From the Latin ‘luculentus’, meaning ‘bright’, ‘shining’, ‘impressive’,
‘gorgeous’. Proof of concept spectral path tracer, released under the

Luculentus traces rays at different wavelengths, giving it the ability
to simulate effects like dispersion and chromatic aberration. It was
written with code clarity as the primary goal; it is not optimised for
speed, although it is multithreaded.
